# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
 
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

The major and minor parts of the version number indicate the compatibility
with the ASP.NET Core framework version (2.2.*, 3.0.*, 5.0.*) and only
the build part is actually indicating the release version of the project.

## [*.*.3] - 2021-05-08

### Changed
* `RequestScope` is now inheriting from `Ninject.Infrastructure.Disposal.DisposableObject`
  and therefore implements `INotifyWhenDisposed` which means that services that are tied
  to the request scope will be disposed _immediately_ when the request scope is disposed.
  This should improve the memory performance since objects bound to the request scope
  can release their unmanaged resources sooner.

## [*.*.2] - 2020-11-19

With this update, some of the class names had their inconsistent naming
fixed from "NInject" to "Ninject". The compiler will complain when you
update and the issue is trivial to fix.

### Added
* Added support for custom controller activator type

### Changed
* `NinjectServiceProvider` is now implementing `ISupportRequiredService`
  and provides much better exceptions when a required service cannot be
  resolved

### Fixed
* Consolidated class naming (fixed "NInject" to "Ninject")

## [*.*.1] - 2020-11-11

### Added
* Configurable blocking behavior of INinjectSelfHost implementation
* Signing assemblies with a strong name

### Fixed
* Added missing develop static web assets configuration for ASP.NET Core 3+

## [*.*.0] - 2020-11-08

Initial release for internal testing and figuring out the release procedure with NuGet packages.
