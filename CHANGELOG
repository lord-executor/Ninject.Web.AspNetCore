# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
 
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

The major and minor parts of the version number indicate the compatibility
with the ASP.NET Core framework version (2.2.*, 3.0.*, 5.0.*) and only
the build part is actually indicating the release version of the project.

## [*.*.2] - 2020-11-19

With this update, some of the class names had their inconsistent naming
fixed from "NInject" to "Ninject". The compiler will complain when you
update and the issue is trivial to fix.

### Added
* Added support for custom controller activator type

### Changed
* `NinjectServiceProvider` is now implementing `ISupportRequiredService`
  and provides much better exceptions when a required service cannot be
  resolved

### Fixed
* Consolidated class naming (fixed "NInject" to "Ninject")

## [*.*.1] - 2020-11-11

### Added
